New ginger bug initiated 1/22/2021!

**Make a ginger bug:**
- collect about a finger's worth of organic ginger, including the peel, ideally from making a delicious curry, put in a jar 
- in a saucepan, warm 2 cups filtered (NON-CHLORINATED) water 
- add 2 teaspoons sugar, stir to dissolve
- cool to room temp, then add to ginger jar
- seal tightly and store at room temp
- the next day, and for 5 days thereafter, add a spoonful of sugar and a knuckle of ginger bits to 'feed' the bug, keeping jar tightly sealed
- after a few days, the bubbles will let you know *it's alive!*

**Use a ginger bug:**
- strain about 1/2 cup bug into ~8 cups fruit juice, teas etc
- to use quickly, add carbonated water to the above
- for maximum probiotic benefit, bottle the mixture and allow to ferment a few days
