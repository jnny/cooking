# Samosa Soup

*Based on Burma Superstar's cookbook*

## Ingredients:

For 4-6 portions - just double this in a big pot and refrigerate or freeze when the soup base is done1

### Soup:
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 tsp black mustard seeds
- 1/3 cup canola oil
- 4 small dried chiles
- 3 bay leaves
- 2 cups diced yellow onion
- 1/4 cup minced garlic
- 1.5 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 3 tsp salt
- 1/4 toasted chickpea flour
- 6.5 cups water
- 1/2 cup [Tamarind Water](tamarindwater.md)
- 1/2 jalapeno or 2 Thai chiles, minced
- 1/2 tsp [Garam Masala](spiceblends/garammasala.md)
- 1/4 cup torn mint leaves

### Serve:
- 12 small baked or fried frozen samosas
- optional: fried bits of potato / falafel
- 2 cups shredded cabbage
- 1 cup cilantro
- 1 lime, cut into wedges

## Instructions
* Toast the cumin and mustard seeds til mustard seeds begin to pop, grind in spice grinder (or mortar and pestle it)
* In a large heavy pot, heat the oil and drop in chiles, bay leaves, and mustard-cumin spice mix. Let fry for about a minute.
* Stir in onions and garlic, on high for ~5 minutes.
* Add paprike, turmeric and salt.
* Add 1/2 cup water to toasted chickpea flour in a bowl, stir to remove clumps.

# Tips
* The tamarind water is not essentially, but adds a nice umami-sweetness. You could also add MSG and a touch of sugar ;)
* The toasted chickpea flour is really good... We ground dried chickpeas into flour using some small mill contraption juul procured on the cheap, made a big batch and keep it in a ziplock with our flours - just dry-toast on a skillet for a few minutes and add it in!

# Expert Mode:
* Have a fresh-ground mustard-cumin spice blend on your rack
* Make your own samosas and keep them frozen (I'm not quite there yet, but they are delicious homemade!)
* Make your own paratha or roti for dipping (we use frozen parathas&roti)
