**Ingredients:**
- 1 large root veg like taro, yuca, malanga blanca (about 12 ounces), peeled and grated, about 2 cups
- 1/3 cup minced red bell pepper
- 1/3 cup petite peas
- 1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced
- 2 green onions, minced
- 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon minced cilantro
- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Coconut oil for frying
- Sour cream and chutney for serving (or [harissa yogurt!](harissayogurt.md)
 
**Instructions:**
- Mix the malanga, bell pepper, peas, jalapeño pepper, green onions, lemon juice, cilantro, garam masala, cayenne, and salt in a bowl until well combined.
- Add enough coconut oil to a large, flat-bottomed skillet until it coats the bottom and place over medium heat. When the oil is hot but not smoking, spoon about 1/4 cup of the malanga mixture into the hot oil and flatten slightly with the back of the spoon. Repeat until you fill the bottom of the skillet. Fry the latkes for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown and crispy. Drain on paper towels and serve hot with sour cream and chutney.
