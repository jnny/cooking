# PassionGinger Mocktail

* Passionfruit pulp (love Amazonas Pulpa de Parcha, which I found at Mi Tierra market in Berkley off University)
* Ginger beer (Fevertree, obviously)
* Blend it all on high for at least two minutes to crush up some of the seeds
* Mint and lime to garnish (optional, it's great just on its own!)

TODO: Add photos. So pretty!
