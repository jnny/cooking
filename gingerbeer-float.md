Not a 'recipe' so much as a stroke of genius: Ginger Beer Floats!

## Ingredients
* Ginger Beer (in order of personal preference: Fevertree, Reeds Extra, Bundaberg, Cock 'n Bull)
* Ice cream of choice (amazing w/ Ben & Jerry's Strawberry Cheesecake!)

## Instructions
* Add 1-2 scoops of ice cream to a glass and let get a bit melty (or use room temperature ginger beer to do the work)
* Fill glass to top with ginger beer and mix with a skinny wisk, long spoon or one of those cappucino-frothing wands
* Best sipped through a metal straw of course - enjoy!
