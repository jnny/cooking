## Instructions

_Obviously, stir stir stir throughout!_
1. Chop and fry the bacon w/ a bit of oil
2. Chop and add the onions
3. Chop and add leeks and carrots
4. Add celery stalks and root (I replaced the root with parsnips)
5. Chop and add potatoes
6. Add dried peas to the mix
7. Add nutmeg and bay leaves
8. Add water [edit: or broth sounds better]
9. Add chicken [HIGHLY CONTESTED in the comments]
10. Cover and simmer 20 mins [again this is cuz of the contestable chicken...]
11. Find and remove chicken so it doesn't get overcooked, wrap in tinfoil and set aside
12. Cover and cook for anouther half hour (30 mins)
13. Andong contentiously uses a stick blender to expedite [so maybe do not cover[
14. Segue shredding of the unnecessary chicken
15. Throw in your Røget medister (smoked sausage)
16. Simmer for a bit and top with dried onion, sausage, parsley, and _controversial: frozen spinach - eliminate_
17. Season with salt, pepper & msg
18. Optionally serve with rye bread and/or sour cream


## Comments / Variations / Inspiration:

"Ercris soup is a soup made from peas. Ercris soup is known in Indonesia by its Dutch name, erwtensoep as a tempo doeloe food (appetiser). The soup is yellowish-green although a little brown sometimes. Ercis soup, and especially the Dutch variant actually resembles congee more than it does soup because it's very (springy? To the touch? Thick it is!) thick which in turn is because of the stuff inside, namely vegetables like leeks, potatoes, beef/chicken [What? a wortel? Is that Dutch lmao Indonesians]. In the Netherlands, it is usually eaten during winter with bread. The type of bread used can be either a soft roll or hard roll. French bread is also ok. It's up to personal taste. Various types of lentils/legumes can also be added to it such as peanuts and red beans so that you have crunchy stuff to chew on. Sweet corn can also be added as a sweetener. Finally, for fragrance, garlic can be fried [and added to it] and for freshness, it is advised to add thin slices of pickled fruits/lemon."

"I grew up on snert, like every proper dutch kid, ice skating in winter. You’re research is so good, but I’m quite shocked how far you strayed from the original, which does take a few hours but is actually much easier! Let me just mentioned the key problems, and I’m not talking abt your own additions, which seem weird but rather nice. 1. Much more peas, ideally fresh or frozen! (Which is also a time saver) 2. Do not fry up any bacon, but simmer a piece of smoked pork belly or shoulder within the soup. Served in thin slices on top. This allows you to ration the meat. It is actually a true vegetable soup. Chicken is unheard of, and doesn’t offer the sticky fattiness of pork. 3. A Big winter Carrot!  Great you found the celery root though, that’s key, it can actually entirely replace the potato, making your soup less heavy but more flavorful...! "

"The leeks, the sellery root, the carrot.... those are spot on.   But indeed the chickenbreast is ridiculous.  However you put it in soup, it will be dry and flavourless chewing. Split pea soup is a soup with pork meat. There's no way around it. Spare ribs, marrowbone, pig foot, ham and/or smoked sausage (the real ones). And yeah then adding  spinache ? There's no reason for it.  If you want green soup then use green peas, not yellow ones."
