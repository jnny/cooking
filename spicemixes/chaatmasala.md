Basic essence is toasting chiles, cumin seed, & coriander and grinding together with mango powder, black peppercorns and black salt.

[A more elaborate version I found online:](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2017/11/chaat-masala-spice-blend-recipe.html)

**Ingredients:**
- 2 1/2 tablespoons (12g) cumin seeds
- 1 tablespoon (5g) coriander seeds
- 1 1/2 teaspoons (4g) fennel seeds
- 1 1/2 teaspoons (3g) ajwain seeds
- 1 tablespoon (3g) dried mint
* 1 tablespoon (13g) kala namak powder
* 1 teaspoon (5g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
* 3 tablespoons (18g) green mango powder
* 4 1/2 teaspoons (16g) tamarind powder
* 1 teaspoon (2g) whole black peppercorns
* 5 teaspoons (12g) Kashmiri red chili powder (see note)
* 1 teaspoon (2g) ginger powder

**Instructions:**
- In a dry saut√© pan over medium heat, working with one spice at a time, toast cumin seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, and ajwain until just warm and fragrant, taking care not to burn the seeds. Set each spice aside as it is done.
- In a high-powered blender or spice grinder, or using a mortar and pestle, combine all toasted spices along with dried mint, kala namak, salt, green mango powder, tamarind powder, black peppercorns, chili powder, and ginger powder. Grind to a fine powder. If using a spice grinder with a limited capacity, grind each ingredient in batches, then thoroughly combine in a small mixing bowl.
- Store masala in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 3 months. The masala's flavor is best the day after making, once the spices have had a chance to mingle.
