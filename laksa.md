# Singaporean Laksa

Original recipe courtesy of https://nomadette.com/singapore-laksa-noodles/

## Ingredients:

### Asian Market:
- Prawns 400g (w/ heads and shells)
- Bean sprouts
- Galangal (thumb size), finally sliced
- Fish cakes
- Tofu puffs / Tao Pek (or deepfry a block of firm tofu cut into 1"x2" slivers)
- Laksa leaves (if you can find), or sub coriander or lemon basil)
- Shrimp paste (Belachan) 1 tbsp
- Dried shrimps
- Dried chilis (I used 12 for a spicy broth - add more or less to preference)
- Sambal Oelek (optional)

### Produce:
- 5 thai chilis
- 3 shallots
- 3-4 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp ginger
- 1 tbsp fresh turmeric
- Boiled eggs
- Lemongrass (two stalks, use the slim white inner core only), chopped finely
- Macademias (4-5)

### Pantry:
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds (ground in spice grinder)
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 can coconut milk
- Thick Vermicelli / Laksa Rice Noodles / Bee Tai Mak

## Process
- Soak the dried chilis in hot water to soften (after removing stems and seeds)
- Shell the prawns and add heads and shells to pot for making stock. Add 4 cups water and bring to a boil, then simmer for 45 mins- 1 hr w/ lid on.
- Meanwhile, make the laksa spice paste by adding the chilis, garlic, galangal, lemongrass, turmeric, shallots, shrimp paste, dried shrimps, macademias, and fresh-ground coriander to a food processor and blending well. Add some of the reserved chili water if a more pastelike consistency is needed.
- Drain the prawn stock into a separate bowl and dispose of the prawn shells. Clean the pot, then add oil and once hot, the laksa paste. Saute with the oil until a separation occurs between the oil and the paste becomes drier. 
- Add a can of coconut milk, wait for the mixture to begin to bubble, then add the prawn stock, fish sauce and brown sugar.
- Add tofu puffs and laksa leaves, allow mixture to come to a boil, then stick a lid on it.
- Hard boil 1 egg per person, then quick boil the noodles. Meanwhile, turn the heat back on the pot and add the prawns and fish cakes.
- To serve, grab some noodles, scoop some soup, add an extra layer of gravy, and top with bean sprouts and the peeled boiled egg (optionally add also coriander and a small spoonful sambal oelek)
