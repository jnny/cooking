## Ingredients: 

### Vegan Meat Crumble

* a can of beans or equivalent dried after soaking
* 2 cups rolled oats
* 2 Thai chiles
* Lemongrass, 1 4" piece (optional)
* Olive oil
* Curry paste
* Tamari or regular soy sauce

### Dressing
* 2 TBSP tamari or soy sauce
* 4 limes
* Ground chili powder
* 3 TBSP ground roasted rice
* Mint and cilantro

### Garnish
* Firm lettuce leaf (Romaine or cabbage) to hold it all together
* Cilantro, parsley or other herbs 
* 1 purple onion, roughly chopped
* Lime slices 
* Finely minced chiles (optional)

[Instructions via Tae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_6JuIcJiBE) with additions from me:
1. Slice the firm tofu and throw it into a blender. Blend it until itâ€™s a nice mush. 
2. Next up mushrooms and red onions, keep that blender going.
3. Finally blend the beans and oats into and blend up.
4. Take all three blended mixtures and mix them together.
5. Get your hands in the mixture, feel it, mix it together.
6. Give it a Thai kick by mixing in the chilis and lemongrass. 
7. Grill all that goodness together until it looks like ground beef
8. Meanwhile make the dressing by rinsing out the food processor and adding all of the ingredients to it. 
9. May first want to make some [ground roasted rice](https://www.eatingthaifood.com/toasted-rice-powder-recipe/) for added umami! (I just toast some on a dry pan then grind it in a spice mill, but you can also use a mortar and pestle)
10. Blend until smooth. Pour the dressing into the skillet and stir until everything is evenly coated. Cook for another 10 minutes, until most of the liquid has absorbed.
11. Spoon the vegan meat mixture into the lettuce leaves and garnish with herbs, more purple onion and a squeeze of lime before serving.

Soooo addictive, and makes enough to last as a snack for days!
