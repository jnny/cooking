via https://www.seriouseats.com/kaya-toast-recipe-8599165

## Ingredients

For the Kaya:
* 4 large eggs
* 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar (10 1/2 ounces; 300 g), divided
* 1 (14.5-ounce) can coconut cream, such as Aroy-D, stirred
* 2 tablespoons (30 ml) unrefined coconut oil

For the Kaya Toast:
* 2 slices white sandwich bread, crusts removed and lightly toasted
* 2 tablespoons (30 ml) kaya, homemade or store-bought, room temperature
* 4 tablespoons cold salted butter (56 g; 2 ounces), sliced into 1/8-inch thick slabs
* 2 soft boiled-eggs (optional, for serving)
* Hot coffee (optional, for serving)

## Directions

1. In a medium bowl, whisk eggs. Strain eggs through a fine-mesh sieve into a large metal heat-proof bowl, and whisk in 1 cup 3 tablespoons (240g) granulated sugar until well incorporated.
2. Set the bowl over a pot of simmering water; cook, and, using a whisk or flexible spatula, stir gently and constantly, until the mixture reaches 176ºF (80ºC) and begins to set and resemble a thick pancake batter, 12 to 18 minutes.
3. Stir in coconut milk and continue to cook, stirring gently, until the mixture reaches at least 176ºF (80°C), 10 to 12 minutes longer. Remove from heat and stir occasionally to prevent kaya from overcooking.
4. In a small saucepan set over low heat, sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons (60g) sugar in an even layer and cook, undisturbed, until sugar has melted and is a dark amber color, about 6 minutes. Add coconut oil and, using a clean, dry whisk, stir continuously until smooth.
5. Pour coconut oil syrup into the kaya mixture and stir well to combine, making sure to quickly and constantly whisk to prevent the caramel from scrambling the eggs in the custard. Continue cooking kaya until it reaches 176ºF (80ºC). Remove kaya from heat and, using a fine-mesh sieve, strain cooked kaya into heat-proof jars, let cool, and refrigerate.
6. For the Kaya Toast: Using a butter knife or offset spatula, spread about 1 tablespoon of kaya over each slice of toast. Place 2 thin slabs of cold salted butter on one of the slices, and close the sandwich. Slice the toast sandwich lengthways and serve immediately with strong hot coffee or milk tea.
